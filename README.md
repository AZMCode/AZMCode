# Hello there.
I am a dude who likes to code.
Not much to talk about there is there?

# What I know
Anyways, I know and love Rust, Typescript, Javascript, Node.JS, have some experience with Electron, and know a little bit of Python and C++.
I sometimes work on open source projects to make my own life, and possibly other people's lives just a bit better.
I am enormously interested in cryptography and its possibilities.

Here's a selection of some of my favorites:

 - [RPNCalc][https://github.com/AZMCode/rpncalc]
   - A scripting/calculation library written in Rust, with both a functioning TUI, editor syntax highlighting, and a slightly lackluster PWA. Written entirely in Rust. Even the web app.
 - [asdf-jq][https://github.com/asdf-jq]
   - A FOSS project I rewrote then eventually became the owner of its primary fork, for (asdf-vm)[https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf]. Written entirely in Bash.

   - A de-obfuscation, rewriting, and reencoding to midi format of a Code Golf snippet that plays music, [originally written by Robert Miles][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqZgoNRERY8]. Written entirely in Rust.
