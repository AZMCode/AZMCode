# Hello there.
I am a dude who likes to code.
Not much to talk about there is there?

# What I know
Anyways, I know and love Rust, Typescript, Javascript, Node.JS, have some experience with Electron, and know a little bit of Python and C++.
I sometimes work on open source projects to make my own life, and possibly other people's lives just a bit better.
I am enormously interested in cryptography and its possibilities.
